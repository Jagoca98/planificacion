# PR - Entregable

## This is a list of the changes in the Python project.
- Relative paths are used for files
- BFS implemented less sequentially 
- Added PyGame graphical interface
- Predefined map selector
- BFS modified to work with the 8 neighbors
- BFS modified to sort nodes based on distance to the goal

### Description

This project contains a series of files that incorporate a bfs-based graph search with a distance-to-target heuristic. It also contains a set of predefined maps on which the search is performed. This project requires PyGame for the visualization of the path search.

### Instructions

In Ubuntu:

- Unzip the proyect

```
$ unzip planificacion.zip -d ~/
```

or

- git clone the proyect

```
$ git -C ~ clone https://github.com/Jagoca98/planificacion.git
```

- cd to the master-ipr/src/python/algorithms/bfs

```
$ cd ~/planificacion/master-ipr/src/python/algorithms/bfs
```

- Execute the bfs-class-sorted.py

```
$ python3 bfs-class-sorted.py
```

- Select the map and enjoy!
